Assessment of the project

a) This project is the groundwork of a Java interface for commafeed.com . Originally it was supposed to provide basic authentication but currently it's not working due to being out of date with the API REST for commafeed.

b) The program doesn't run so there are not user stories for the current state.

c) The program doesn't run. The code is out of date with the API from commafeed.

c)- As a developer I can authenticate users with commafeed so that I can have access to their account's information.
  - As a developer I can have acces to the user's information so that I can display their RSS feed in a GUI.
  - As a user I can login with my commafeed account so that my RSS feed is displayed to me in an organized way.
  - As a user I can manage my RSS feed directly from the Java interface so that I don't have to login to commafeed.com in a web browser.
  - As a developer I can analyze the user's RSS feed so that I can suggest RSS feeds they might like or be interested in.

d) The current state of the README.md file is pretty bare. It doens't include enough information for a developer to know what the project exactly does or where to start. Some helpful things that could be added to the README for future developers are:  
   - A goal log which deatails which milestones the developer team has achieved and which ones are still in progress.
   - A simple walkthrough of how the user would use the app and where important code that "characterizes" the project lie.

e) The build.xml file currently explains every target. The description for "run" includes an enviroment variable $(mainClass) that does not correctly replace with the right name. The description literally prints $(mainClass), this should be fixed.

f) The currect issues are clear but seem to all depend on the code not currently running. We think that once this issue is cleared up, more issues will become apparent and there will be more to work on in this project.

g) We found that the javadoc created for the commafeed interface doesn't have description for most of it's classes and methods. If this is changed and  clear and detailed descriptions were added, people working on the code would have a better idea of what to do. The link to the issue is the following:


[Javadoc class and method description](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-rss-reader/issues/10)
[Implement test coverage for API](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-rss-reader/issues/11)
[Collect data from the user's feed for later usage in different features](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-utilities-rss-reader/issues/12)

h) The code is organized well, but it took us a while to understand exactly what each class and method were doing. We think the problem lies in the bare README file. If this file had more information, it would have been easier to make our way through the code. Furthermore, looking at the Javadoc does not clear up the purpose of the classes and methods, either. Only two of the classes are explained in the main page, and those classes also have method descriptions.
	AuthenticationException.java - This is a well organized exception method and each method makes sense. The comment at the top also helps with understanding the purpose of the class.

	CommaFeed.java - This class is the basic authentication that the Java interface will eventually need to function. The code and methods are all clean and easy to understand. Private/public members make sense. We only have a concern with a hardcoded password string. There should be a much better way to handle user security, but for the basics, this can work.

	CommaFeedTest.java - The tests for the CommaFeed class. Each method is commented to explain exactly what they do. There are no problems understanding this file, and it is organized well.

	StringUtils.java - This file is straightforward. The purpose, to encode a string, does not seem to be a feature of the program itself but a general purpose method being leveraged to serve the program.

	User.java - This file is tough to understand without a slow line by line look over. This file should contain the types of comments seen in the others. For example, the parseProfile and parseSettings methods are still a mystery to us. The inner classes however are straightforward and their variables make sense. 

	UserTest.java - Straightforward and easy to understand tests for the User class.

i) The test coverage is not comprehensive. The tests currently check to see if the constructor for the Commafeed class works for both the default the two parameter case. However, the two parameter case (username and password) pass "demo" and "demo" for both fields. There needs to be tests implemented that would fail because the app cannot communicate correctly with the API. An issue in the original repo says "out of date with the Commafeed API," and we think this should have been discovered through some sort of unit test. We are not sure how to exactly implement this test, but it should be there.
