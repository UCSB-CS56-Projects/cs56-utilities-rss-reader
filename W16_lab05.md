Code Review for cs56-utilities-rss-reader

Assesment of the project

a) This project is the groundwork of a Java interface for commafeed.com . Originally it was supposed to provide basic authentication but currently it's not working due to being our of date with the API REST for commafeed.

b) The program doesn't run so there are not user stories.

c) The program doesn't run. The code is out of date with the API from commafeed.

c)- As a developer I can authenticate users with commafeed so that I can have access to their account's information.
  - As a developer I can have acces to the user's information so that I can display their RSS feed in a GUI.
  - As a user I can login with my commafeed account so that my RSS feed is displayed to me in an organized way.
  - As a user I can manage my RSS feed directly from the Java interface so that I don't have to login to commafeed.com in a web browser.
  - As a developer I can analyze the user's RSS feed so that I can suggest RSS feeds they might like or be interested in.

d) The current state of the README.md file is pretty bare. It doens't include enough information for a developer to know what the project exactly does or where to start. Some helpful things that could be added to the README for future developers are:  
   - A goal log which deatails which milestones the developer team has achieved and which ones are still in progress.
   - 
e) The build.xml file currently explain every target. The description for "run" includes an enviroment variable $(mainClass) that does not correctly replace with the right name. The description literally prints $(mainClass), this should be fixed.

f) The currect issues are clear but seem to all depend on the code not currently running. We think that once this issue is cleared up, more issues will become apparent and there will be more to work on in this project.

g) We did not add any issues to the repo.

h) The code is organized well, but it took us a while to understand exactly what each class and method were doing. We think the problem lies in the bare README file. If this file had more information, it would have been easier to make our way through the code. Furthermore, looking at the Javadoc does not clear up the purpose of the classes and methods, either. Only two of the classes are explained in the main page, and those classes also have method descriptions.
